            Dear Owners/Residents, We were recently notified that there were two
            new COVID-19 cases in our building. Please continue to wear masks in
            public areas of the building, follow the social distancing
            protocols, and protect yourselves from COVID-19. The gym, sauna
            room, and swimming pool will be temporary closed due to the new
            COVID-19 outbreak. Should you have any questions, feel free to
            contact me. Thank you for your attention. Stay safe! Dwight
          </p>
